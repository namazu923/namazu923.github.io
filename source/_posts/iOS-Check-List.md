# Swift
* [The Swift Programming Language (Swift 4)](https://developer.apple.com/library/content/documentation/Swift/Conceptual/Swift_Programming_Language/index.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40014097-CH3-ID0)

* [Swift Standard Library](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swift)

> **Explore the Standard Library**
Experiment with Swift standard library types and learn high-level concepts using visualizations and practical examples. Learn how the Swift standard library uses protocols and generics to express powerful constraints. Download the playground below to get started.

* [Using Swift with Cocoa and Objective-C(Swift 4)](https://developer.apple.com/library/content/documentation/Swift/Conceptual/BuildingCocoaApps/index.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40014216-CH2-ID0)

> Swift is designed to provide seamless compatibility with Cocoa and Objective-C. You can use Objective-C APIs in Swift, and you can use Swift APIs in Objective-C. This makes Swift an easy, convenient, and powerful tool to integrate into your development workflow.
>
This guide covers three important aspects of Swift and Objective-C compatibility that you can use to your advantage when developing Cocoa apps:
>
> * Interoperability lets you interface between Swift and Objective-C code, allowing you to use Swift classes in Objective-C and to take advantage of familiar Cocoa classes, patterns, and practices when writing Swift code.
> * Mix and match allows you to create mixed-language apps containing both Swift and Objective-C files that can communicate with each other.
> * Migration from existing Objective-C code to Swift is made easy with interoperability and mix and match, making it possible to replace parts of your Objective-C apps with the latest Swift features.

# Playgroung
* [Markup Formatting Reference](https://developer.apple.com/library/content/documentation/Xcode/Reference/xcode_markup_formatting_ref/index.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40016497-CH2-SW1)

> Markup Overview
Use markup to create playgrounds that show formatted text in rendered documentation mode and to show Quick Help for your Swift code symbols.
>
Markup for playgrounds includes page level formatting for headings and other elements, formatting spans of characters, showing inline images, and several other features.
